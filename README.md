## Description
[Horiseon](https://will-dean5.github.io/horiseon-refactor-project/)

Added semantics to html. I uncluttered css elements that were doing the same functions. Added a descriptive title to the head of the document, got rid of all of the divs and replaced them the appropriate semantic elements. The html elements follow a logical structure, added alt attributes to images. The heading elements fall into sequential order.
